# Movies-ETL

Understand the concept of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) on several movie datasets.

Challenge
The function extracts data from three filepaths: wikipedia.movies.json, movies_metadata.csv, and ratings.csv. Then transform steps, which include cleaning data from both Wikipedia and Kaggle. Finally the Wikipedia and Kaggle Movies datasets are merged into one dataset. The newly transformed datasets are then loaded into SQL database for further analysis.
